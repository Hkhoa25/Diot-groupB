# Project Roadmap: Next Steps

## 1. Refine and Expand the API
- **Add New Endpoints**:
  - `/status`: Return the status of the API or connected devices.
  - `/latest`: Fetch the most recent recorded data.
  - `/history`: Query historical data from InfluxDB.
  
- **Improve Error Handling**:
  - Ensure meaningful responses for scenarios like invalid queries or database connection issues.

- **Implement Authentication**:
  - Secure the API using authentication mechanisms such as API keys or OAuth.

---

## 2. Visualization and Monitoring
- **Set Up a Grafana Dashboard**:
  - Create visualizations for sensor data (e.g., real-time graphs, historical trends).
  - Monitor alerts for threshold breaches.

- **Configure Alerts**:
  - Set up alerts in Grafana or InfluxDB for unusual temperature values.
  - Use services like Slack, email, or webhooks to receive notifications.

---

## 3. Optimize the Data Pipeline
- **Data Aggregation**:
  - Store meaningful aggregated data (e.g., hourly averages) instead of raw data if volume grows too high.

- **Implement Backups**:
  - Schedule periodic backups of InfluxDB data and configurations.

- **Enhance Performance**:
  - Test API performance under load and optimize bottlenecks.
  - Implement caching (e.g., Redis) for frequently queried data.

---

## 4. Extend to IoT Devices
- **Add Multiple Sensors**:
  - Simulate or connect additional devices sending data to the API.
  - Use unique identifiers for each device in the InfluxDB data tags.

- **Deploy Real Hardware**:
  - Transition from simulated sensors (Wokwi) to real IoT devices like Raspberry Pi or ESP32.

- **Enable Remote Management**:
  - Develop endpoints for monitoring and controlling devices remotely.

---

## 5. Explore Advanced Features
- **Leverage Machine Learning**:
  - Use collected data to build predictive models (e.g., temperature forecasting, anomaly detection).

- **Utilize Edge Processing**:
  - Offload some data processing to IoT devices to reduce cloud dependency.

- **Integrate with Other Systems**:
  - Connect with third-party platforms like Home Assistant or Google Cloud for extended functionality.

---

## 6. Documentation and Collaboration
- **Create API Documentation**:
  - Document the API using tools like Swagger or Postman for ease of use.

- **Enhance Version Control**:
  - Use GitHub or GitLab to maintain version control and collaboration.

- **Collect Community Feedback**:
  - Share the project with a community to gather feedback and suggestions for improvement.

---

## Prioritization
- Decide as a team which steps to tackle first based on the project timeline and goals.
- Letâ€™s discuss resources and roles for each task in the meeting.
